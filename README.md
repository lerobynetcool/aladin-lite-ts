Aladin Lite is a Web application which enables HiPS visualization from the browser. It is developed at [CDS, Strasbourg astronomical data center](http://cds.unistra.fr/).

See [A&A 578, A114 (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02291) and [IVOA HiPS Recommendation](http://ivoa.net/documents/HiPS/index.html) for more details about the HiPS standard.

Aladin Lite is built to be easily embeddable in any web page. It powers astronomical portals like [ESASky](https://almascience.eso.org/asax/), [ESO Science Archive portal](http://archive.eso.org/scienceportal/) and [ALMA Portal](https://almascience.eso.org/asax/).
